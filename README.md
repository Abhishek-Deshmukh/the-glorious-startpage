- [x] Dynamic Background 
- [ ] Cleaner code

### Important Note

+ Typing your search query will automatically open the search box. You can also open it by pressing on the leftmost button in panel or by clicking your profile picture.
+ I'm using the `backdrop-filter` property to have the blur effect for the panels. If you're using Firefox, find `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` then enable it.
+ Openweather map key is not included!
+ Put your config in `js/config.js`.
+ The code could be better, this is my first time writing a startpage from the ground up. I will improve this from time to time.
+ If you discovered a bug, please open an issue so I can fix it.
